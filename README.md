ðŸ“Š Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations
Objective

Analyze monthly revenue and order volume from an online sales dataset to identify sales trends and patterns over time.

Tools & Technologies

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite

SQL Functions: EXTRACT(), SUM(), COUNT(DISTINCT ...)

Additional Tools: Optional Python / Excel for visualization

Dataset

Table Name: orders

Columns:

order_id â€“ Unique identifier for each order

order_date â€“ Date of the order

amount â€“ Revenue amount for each order

product_id â€“ Identifier for the product sold

Analysis Steps

Extract Year and Month

EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month


Aggregate Revenue and Order Volume

SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume


Group Data by Year and Month

GROUP BY year, month


Sort and Limit Results

ORDER BY year, month
LIMIT 12; -- Optional: last 12 months

Sample SQL Script
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM orders
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;

Expected Outcome
Year	Month	Total Revenue	Order Volume
2023	1	12500.00	120
2023	2	14300.00	135
â€¦	â€¦	â€¦	â€¦

Total Revenue: Sum of all orders in a given month.

Order Volume: Number of unique orders in a given month.

Trend Analysis: Identify seasonal trends, growth patterns, and peak sales months.
